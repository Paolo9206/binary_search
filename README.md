Project Title:

Binary Search

Description:

What is a Binary search?:

Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array.
If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. 
Otherwise narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.

With this program we can see how binary search is more efficient than a linear search in a large array.
Our array will have 20000 objects inside it.
In this program I will perform an object search through a linear search and then I will use binary search.
Using python's time() function, we might notice that binary search is faster and more efficient than a standard search.
In our example we will save thousandths of a second but imagining to work on a complex code 
or where the search is repeated multiple times, we can easily guess how, thanks to binary search, we can save a lot of time making our program more efficient.
